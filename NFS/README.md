First lets install NFS server on the host machine, and create a directory where our NFS server will serve the files:

1. Master Node Configuration

SSH to master node

```console 
vagrant ssh k8m-m-1
```

Install nfs server

```console 
sudo apt install nfs-server
systemctl enable nfs-server
```

Create share folder and edit permision

```console 
sudo mkdir -p /srv/nfs/home
sudo chmod 777 -R /srv/nfs/home
```

Edit exports

```console 
sudo vim /etc/exports
```
Press i to enable edit. And add two lines to file for each worker node
 
k8s-n-1 192.168.50.12 worker node 1 
k8s-n-2 192.168.50.13 worker node 2

```console 
 /srv/nfs/home      192.168.50.12(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
 /srv/nfs/home      192.168.50.13(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
```
Press escape and 
 
 ```console 
 :wq 
```
to write and quit.

Export the exported file systems

 ```console 
  sudo exportfs -a
```

No Root Squash

 However there is one option that is worth mentioning, no_root_squash. By default NFS will downgrade any files created with the root permissions to the nobody user. This is a security feature that prevents privileges from being shared unless specifically requested.


Make sure nfs server is active and running. 

```console 
 sudo systemctl status nfs-server
```
Note: if status is active(exited) it also working :) 

Make sure rpcbind is active and running. 

```console 
 sudo systemctl status rpcbind
```

2. Worker Node Configuration

SSH to worker node

```console 
vagrant ssh k8m-n-1
```

Create folder to mount to server shared folder

 ```console 
  mkdir  /mnt/sharedir
```

Mount 

 ```console 
  sudo mount  192.168.50.11:/srv/nfs/home  /mnt/sharedir
```

Note: If mount command fails wait some time, it will work.


Worker Node Configuration steps must be applied for second k8s-n-2 worker node. 

3. Deployment

Navigate to deploy folder

Service account must be set 

 ```console 
  kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```

Create an NFS persistence volume storage class

 ```console 
  kubectl apply -f class.yaml 
```

The NFS client provisioner will be set as a pod

 ```console 
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
For Testing

Creating persistence volume claim file and deploying it

 ```console 
  kubectl apply -f claim.yaml
```

Navigate to master nodes /srv/nfs/home new folder should be crated
